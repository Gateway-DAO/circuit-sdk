/// Determines if the remaining budget after expenses is within the allowable limit.

/// # Parameters
/// - `budget`: The initial budget available.
/// - `spent`: The amount already spent from the budget.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `bool`: Returns `true` if the remaining budget is less than or equal to the maximum allowable,
///   indicating spending is within the limits, otherwise `false`.
///
/// # Example
/// This example demonstrates checking if a remaining budget of 3000 (after spending 2000 from a budget of 5000)
/// stays within the maximum allowable limit of 3000.
