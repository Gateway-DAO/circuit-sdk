/// Determines if a candidate has received enough votes to pass the specified threshold.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `votes`: The number of votes the candidate has received.
/// - `threshold`: The minimum number of votes required for the candidate to pass.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `bool`: Returns `true` if the votes are greater than or equal to the threshold,
///   indicating the candidate has met the required vote count, otherwise `false`.
///
/// # Example
/// This example demonstrates checking if a candidate with 150 votes meets a threshold of 100 votes.
